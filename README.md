# Install and Run

:warning: Make sure you're installing from a non-`root` user with `sudo` permissons, because some components aren't intended to be installed as root and probably won't work, but nevertheless require `sudo` to install.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Make sure you have set up your hostname DNS records for your VPS prior to install, as we use LetsEncrypt to get certificates for the web application.

ü•á You need to respond "Y" to some prompts throughout the install, so be sure to sit there and complete it and not let it time out.


1. `git clone https://github.com/dosyago/BrowserBoxPro`
2. `cd BrowserBoxPro`
3. `./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh`
4. `setup_bbpro --port 8080` (this will output the login link)
5. `bbpro`

Then, use the login link output in step 4 to connect to the virtual browser (from a regular mobile or desktop browser). 

‚ÑπÔ∏è You may observe some errors during the install! As long as everything runs, you can safely ignore those, because they're likely branches for different OSes. 

# System Requirements (recommended)

Debian VPS with 2 core, 4 GB RAM, and 100 GB SSD, and at least 10 Mbps connection, *plus a public hostname with a DNS A record pointing to the IP of your VPS, because we provision a TLS certificate for that hostname, and it forms part of the login link!*

Actual requirements depends on what you browse, but the above should give good performance on a range of real-world browsing tasks. If you need better performance, use better hardware.
