# Install and Run

:warning: Make sure you're installing from a non `root` user with `sudo` permissons, because some components aren't intended to be installed as root and probably won't work.

1. `git clone https://github.com/dosyago/BrowserBoxPro`
2. `cd BrowserBoxPro`
3. `./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh`
4. `setup_bbpro --port 8080`

# System Requirements (recommended)

Debian VPS with 2 core, 4 GB RAM, and 100 GB SSD, and at least 10 Mbps connection.

Actual requirements depends on what you browse, but the above should give good performance on a range of real-world browsing tasks. If you need better performance, use better hardware.
